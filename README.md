# AstroPhysics-Projects

A series of projects from an AstroPhysics lab in 2020, where multiple sets of telescope data were analyzed. 

Project list: 
* Project 1: Assessing the accuracy of the modern detector's ability to count photons, which helps get a gauge for the error we will have when taking actual measurements with the telescope. Compared the error distributions to theoretical Gaussian and Poisson distributions, and computed the read noise and gain. 

* Project 2:
